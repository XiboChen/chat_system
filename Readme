1. I use pthread on server to create a thred for each user.
2. I use select on client, to determine whether read form 
   socket or stdin.

Compile Step:
1. Make to compile the file.
2. "./server [configration_file]" to set up the server.
3. "./client [configration_file]" to set up the client.
4. On the client:
    a. "login username" to log in as username;
    b. "logout" to log out;
    c. "chat @username message" to send message to username;
    d. "chat message" to broadcast the messgae to all online users.
    e. "exit" to exit the client.
